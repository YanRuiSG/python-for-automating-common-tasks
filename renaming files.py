Exploring the files current drive
The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. 
OS comes under Pythonâ€™s standard utility modules.

This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. The os and os.path modules 
include many functions to interact with the file system.

'''



import os
import pandas as pd

#get the current working drive
wd1 = os.getcwd()

# save the file names in the current drive to a list
file_names = os.listdir(wd1)
#display(file_names)

# create a list of the file names for the excel files in the current drive
excel_files = [file for file in file_names if file.endswith('.xlsx')]

display(excel_files)

#count the total number of 'jpg' image files
image_count = sum(1 for file in file_names if file.endswith('.jpg'))
display(image_count)






'''
Create a new folder in the current drive for storing the image files with the converted file names
'''
# create the name for the new folder
folder_name = 'converted file names'

# error handling
if folder_name in os.listdir(os.getcwd()):
    print('Folder name already exist in current drive')
else:
    # further error handling
    try:
        #create the path for the new folder
        path = os.path.join(wd1, folder_name)
        # create the new folder
        os.mkdir(path)

        print('Folder name could not be created, please check again.')

Import the excel file data for the countries/capital
Clean and tidy the dataset by removing leading and trailing white spaces

Use a left merge to find the corresponding capital names for the unconverted image file names
Create a list of values for the corresponding capital names

Copying the image files over to 'converted file names' Folder
The shutil module provides functions for copying files, as well as entire folders.

For copying multiple files at once, you'll have to have a list of all files you want to copy and loop over them to copy them.
